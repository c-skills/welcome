After decades of `c->skills` projects that brought the world quite some [0days and lot of Open Source projects](https://github.com/stealth), I founded my own company in 2021 - in order to offer code review and refactoring at the commercial level.

`c->skills research` reviews and refactors code for security and performance issues
in Open Source and client-internal software.

Security reviews are available for projects written in the following languages:

* Assembly for x86, x64, ARM and ARM64
* C
* C++
* Go
* Java
* Javascript
* Lua
* Node
* Perl
* PHP
* Python

This includes review of cryptographic protocols and their implementation in code.

Performance reviews and refactoring is available for `C, C++, Perl and Golang` projects. I have some example
projects for high performance [webservers](https://github.com/stealth/lophttpd) and [parallel grep.](https://github.com/stealth/grab)

Some of our clients allow us to share patches we made for them for Open Source
projects. These will go into the [patches repo.](https://github.com/c-skills/patches)

`c->skills` also reverses Android APKs or Router and IoT firmware images for security issues and potential back-doors:

At times, we [sponsor code reviews](https://github.com/c-skills/tinkershell) for Open Source projects out
of our own pocket. You can also ask us about sample audit reports that we created for some Open Source projects.

We have a strong background on *Linux*, *BSD* and everything that is *UNIX-ish*
or `use Sockets;` - so we also refactor and port existing code between distributions
or versions, if API changes throw compile-time errors at our clients.

We do all code reviews fully remote. If you want to get in touch with us for a
potential project, you can find the GPG key with contact address inside this repo.
