Welcome! I am `Sebastian`, a notorious with a proven track-record of [0day vulnerabilities and exploits.](https://github.com/c-skills/CVEs)

In 2021, I founded my own company:

</p>


From now on referred to as `we`.


Our core competencies and services are:


* Code review for security and performance issues, including the cryptography, protocols and their implementation inside
  your project. Creating of PoCs.

* Code recycling: Refactoring, integrating or porting of software to different platforms, architectures or standards.
  E.g.:

```
  C     <-> C11   <-> C20      <-> ... <-> -Werror -pedantic
  C++98 <-> C++11 <-> C++20    <-> ... <-> -Werror -pedantic
  ISO   <-> ANSI  <-> POSIX    <-> ... <-> -Werror -pedantic
  Linux <-> BSD   <-> Embedded <-> ... <-> free-standing

```

* Supply-Chain attack surface review of your Tech-stacks, as outlined [in this example](https://github.com/c-skills/rust1).
  Including review of [DevOps surfaces](https://github.com/stealth/devpops) or tracking of firmware back-doors:

* Code and deployment review of AI frameworks and environments for security, as demonstrated in [this blog writeup.](https://c-skills.blogspot.com/2025/02/ai-0day-trickery.html)

* Code review and integration of AI or otherwise generated code into your projects to meet quality and security standards
  and best practices.

* Evaluation and inventory of your own code-base to help Investors and Management to independently vet their own assets and
  prevent lurking dragons.


Some of our clients allow us to share patches we made for them for Open Source
projects. These will go into the [patches repo.](https://github.com/c-skills/patches) If you depend on Open Source
projects and want to sponsor code reviews to return something to the community and let them know, we can also add
sponsoring banners to our repos.

We do all code reviews fully remote. If you want to get in touch with us for a
potential project, you can find the GPG key with contact address inside this repo.
