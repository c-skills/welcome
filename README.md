`c->skills research` is the company and financing arm of [my](https://github.com/stealth) [various](https://github.com/stealth/sshttp) [Open](https://github.com/stealth/opmsg) [Source](https://github.com/stealth/crash) [community](https://github.com/stealth/psc) [c-skills projects](https://github.com/stealth/libusipp) that I drive since more than 20 years.

`c->skills research` conducts Code Reviews for security and performance issues
in Open Source or client-internal software written in

* Assembly for x86 or ARM
* C
* C++
* Go
* Java
* Javascript
* Lua
* Node
* Perl
* PHP
* Python

Some of our clients allow us to share patches we made for them for Open Source
projects. These will go into the [patches repo.](https://github.com/c-skills/patches)

Occasionally, we are payed to reverse Android APKs or IoT firmware images for
potential back-doors. At other times, we [sponsor code reviews](https://github.com/c-skills/tinkershell) for
Open Source projects out of our own pocket. You can also ask us about sample audit reports
that we created for some Open Source projects.

We have a strong background on *Linux*, *BSD* and everything that is *UNIX-ish*
or `use Sockets;` - so we refactor or port existing code between distributions
or versions, if API changes throw compile-time errors at our clients.

We do all Code Reviews fully remote. If you want to get in touch with us for a
potential project, you can find the GPG key with contact address inside this repo.
